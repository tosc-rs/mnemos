/// A Forth VM in which some builtin words are implemented by `async fn`s (or
/// [`Future`]s).
///
/// # Asynchronous Forth VMs
///
/// Asynchronous builtins are asynchronous relative to the *host* context (i.e.,
/// the Rust program in which the Forth VM is embedded), rather than the Forth
/// program that executes within the VM. This means that, unlike a
/// synchronous [`Forth`] VM, the [`AsyncForth::process_line`] method is an
/// [`async fn`]. When the Forth program executes a builtin word that is
/// implemented by an [`async fn`] on the host, the [`AsyncForth::process_line`]
/// will [`.await`] the [`Future`] that implements the builtin word, and will
/// yield if the `Future` is not ready. This allows multiple [`AsyncForth`] VMs
/// to run asynchronously in an async context on the host, yielding when the
/// Forth programs in those VMs sleep or perform asynchronous I/O operations.
///
/// # Providing Async Builtins
///
/// Unlike synchronous builtins, which are provided to the VM as a slice of
/// [`BuiltinEntry`]s, asynchronous builtins require an implementation of the
/// [`AsyncBuiltins`] trait, which provides both a slice of
/// [`AsyncBuiltinEntry`]s and a [method to dispatch builtin names to
/// `Future`s](AsyncBuiltins::dispatch_async). See the documentation for the
/// [`AsyncBuiltins`] trait for details on providing async builtins.
///
/// # Synchronous Builtins
///
/// An `AsyncForth` VM may also have synchronous builtin words. These behave
/// identically to the synchronous builtins in a non-async [`Forth`] VM.
/// Synchronous builtins should be used for any builtin word that does not
/// require performing an asynchronous operation on the host, such as those
/// which perform mathematical operations.
///
/// Synchronous builtins can be provided when the VM is constructed as a static
/// slice of [`BuiltinEntry`]s. They may also be added at runtime using the
/// [`AsyncForth::add_sync_builtin`] and
/// [`AsyncForth::add_sync_builtin_static_name`] method. These methods are
/// identical to the [`Forth::add_builtin`] and
/// [`Forth::add_builtin_static_name`] methods.
