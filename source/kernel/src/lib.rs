//! # The mnemos kernel
//!
//! The mnemos kernel is implemented as a library, with platform-specific code depending on the
//! kernel library and producing the final binary.
//!
//! ## The "kernelspace" entry point
//!
//! At the moment, the kernel requires some "entry point" code, more or less the `main()` function
//! that runs when the system boots, to perform any system-specific initialization.
//!
//! This entry point code is responsible for setting up any hardware or subsystems that exist
//! outside the kernel (or are required by any kernel services), as well as starting and running
//! the kernel itself.
//!
//! ## Setting up the Allocator
//!
//! Before creating the kernel, a [MnemosAlloc][mnemos_alloc::heap::MnemosAlloc] instance must be
//! registered as a [GlobalAlloc][core::alloc::GlobalAlloc], and if the
//! [UnderlyingAllocator][mnemos_alloc::heap::UnderlyingAllocator] requires initialization,
//! it must occur before creating the kernel.
//!
//! The kernel will be allocated using the provided allocator.
//!
//! ## Creating the kernel
//!
//! The allocator and any kernel settings are provided to the kernel constructor. The kernel
//! will allocate itself, and return an owned kernel entity.
//!
//! After creation, the executor is *not* running yet.
//!
//! ## Initialization phase
//!
//! After creating the kernel, we need to register kernel services, which are expected to act as
//! drivers for various system components.
//!
//! Since we are not running the executor yet, the kernel provides an interface,
//! [`Kernel::initialize()`], which takes a future and spawns it on the executor. Futures added with
//! `initialize` still do not run until the later "running" phase.
//!
//! Right now, it is generally suggested you use one or more `initialize`
//! calls to register all (initial) kernel services.
//!
//! ## Running mode
//!
//! Once everything is prepared and initialized, the startup code is expected to call
//! [`Kernel::tick()`] repeatedly. On each call to tick:
//!
//! * The allocator frees any synchronously dropped allocations, making them available for
//!   asynchronous allocation
//! * The async executor is polled
//!
//! AT THE MOMENT, there is no indication of whether all tasks are blocked, which could be use to
//! inform whether we should put the CPU into some kind of sleep mode until a hardware event (like
//! a timer or DMA transaction) is triggered, and an async task has potentially been awoken.
//!
//! ## Not covered: "userspace"
//!
//! At the moment, there is SOME concept of a userspace, which interacts with the kernel via a
//! bidirectional IPC ringbuffer. Space for this ringbuffer is allocated when calling
//! [`Kernel::new()`]. Additionally this ringbuffer is polled on each call to `tick`, after freeing
//! allocations and before calling `tick` on the scheduler.
//!
//! This is an artifact of how mnemos 0.1 worked, where there was a single userspace executor that
//! existed and interacted with the kernel executor.
//!
//! As of 2023-05-30, I don't think this is the right abstraction for multiple userspace processes.
//! The pieces that exist currently are likely to be removed or reworked heavily before they are
//! usable, and should be considered nonfunctional at the moment.
