# Melpomene does not use any APIs from `maitake` directly. This dependency is
# instead required in order to enable `maitake`'s support for `tracing` 0.1.x,
# which is needed to support the Tokio Console while running in the simulator,
# but is not needed by actual builds of mnemOS running on real hardware.
