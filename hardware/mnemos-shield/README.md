# Mnemos Shield

![A render of the layout of the mnemos shield PCB](../../assets/hw-mnemos-shield-v2.png)

This is a basic breakout board for the beepy hardware, to overcome the fact that the MQ-Pro PTH are too small for the pogo pins used by the beepy board.

This board contains three 40-pin headers all connected in parallel with each other. All holes are 1.0mm inner diameter, which seems to work well on the pogo pins.
