# Enables Cargo artifact dependencies.
#
# This allows a crate to depend on a specific binary artifact from another
# crate. This is used as part of the build process for `x86_64` targets using
# `rust-osdev/bootloader`, where a target crate depends on the kernel binary
# artifact from the kernel core crate and links it with the bootloader binary in
# a `build.rs` script.
# 
# Artifact dependencies are also used by `manganese` to depend on binary crates
# as normal Cargo.toml dependencies.
#
# See: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#artifact-dependencies
