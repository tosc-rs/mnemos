# Use the `mycelium-bitfield` crate from the Mycelium monorepo rather than
# crates.io.
# NOTE: this patch, unlike the patches for `maitake` and `mycelium-util`, (which
# are unpublished), is not *strictly* necessary, as `mycelium-bitfield` *is*
# published to crates.io. However, we may as well depend on the git version,
# since it's already in our dependency tree as a transitive dep of `maitake` ---
# having both a Git dep and a crates.io dep seems unfortunate.
