# MnemOS ESP32-C3 WiFi Buddy

This directory contains the MnemOS firmware for the [ESP32-C3] WiFi Buddy.

## Target Boards

The currently targeted [ESP32-C3] development boards are the [Seeedstudio XIAO
ESP32-C3][xiao] and its cousin the [Adafruit QT Py ESP32-C3][qtpy]. These boards
are more or less the same --- they are pinout-compatible and can be flashed over
USB-C.

The only substantial difference is that the Adafruit board includes a
WS2812 "NeoPixel" RGB LED and a Stemma QT JST connector for IÂ²C devices. Neither
of these components are required for the MnemOS WiFi Buddy application, so
either board can be used interchangeably.

## Getting started with MnemOS on the ESP32-C3

### Building

The simplest way to build a MnemOS image for the [ESP32-C3] platform to use the
[`just build-c3` Just recipe][just].

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Running Just recipes requires Just to be installed. See
> [https://just.systems](https://just.systems) for details on using Just.

The two supported ESP32-C3 dev boards are pinout-compatible, but route different
pins on the ESP32 to the pins on the dev board. Therefore, this crate contains
separate Cargo bin targets for each supported dev board, which configure the I/O
pin assignment to match the target devboard before calling into shared code:

* `qtpy`: MnemOS for the [Adafruit QT Py ESP32-C3][qtpy]
* `xiao`: MnemOS for the [Seeedstudio XIAO ESP32-C3][xiao]

The `just build-c3` recipe takes a required argument to select which bin target
is built. For example:

```shell
$ just build-c3 qtpy   # builds MnemOS for the Adafruit QT Py ESP32-C3
$ just build-c3 xiao   # builds MnemOS for the Seeedstudio XIAO ESP32-C3
```

Alternatively, Allwinner D1 images can be built manually using Cargo. To build
using Cargo, run:

```shell
# builds MnemOS for the Adafruit QT Py ESP32-C3
$ cargo build -p mnemos-esp32c3-buddy --bin qtpy --release
# builds MnemOS for the Seeedstudio XIAO ESP32-C3
$ cargo build -p mnemos-esp32c3-buddy --bin xiao --release
```

### Flashing & Running

ESP32-C3 dev boards can be flashed over USB using [`cargo-espflash`]. To flash
an ESP32-C3 board with the MnemOS firmware, either run `cargo espflash flash`
from within this directory, or run the [`just flash-c3` Just recipe][just] from
anywhere in the MnemOS repository.

Like `just build-c3`, the target board must be provided:

```shell
$ just flash-c3 qtpy   # build and flash the Adafruit QT Py ESP32-C3
$ just flash-c3 xiao   # build and flash the Seeedstudio XIAO ESP32-C3
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In order to flash an ESP32-C3 board, the [`cargo-espflash`] executable
> must be installed. The `just flash-c3` Just recipe will check if
> `cargo-espflash` is present, and prompt to install it if it is not found.

If everything worked successfully, you should see output similar to this:

```shell
$ just flash-c3 qtpy
       Found cargo-espflash
cargo build --package mnemos-esp32c3-buddy --bin qtpy --release

Alternatively, the board can be flashed manually using [`cargo-espflash`]. For
example:
```shell
$ cargo espflash flash \
    --package mnemos-esp32c3-buddy \
    --bin qtpy \ # or 'xiao'
    --monitor
